# Troubleshooting

## Provider module not found

If the configuration contains:

```json
"provider": "example"
```

the project must contain:

```text
example_client.py
```

## Ollama endpoint missing

Ollama requires:

```json
"provider_options": {
    "endpoint": "http://localhost:11434",
    "context_window_size": 16384
}
```

## Ollama connection refused

Ollama is separate from the observability stack. Start it with:

```bash
ollama serve
```

Then confirm availability:

```bash
ollama list
```

## OpenAI authentication error

Confirm the key is set:

```bash
python3 -c 'import os; print("set" if os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY") else "missing")'
```

## Anthropic authentication error

Confirm the key is set:

```bash
python3 -c 'import os; print("set" if os.getenv("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY") else "missing")'
```

## Model not found

Confirm that the configured model ID exists and is available to the selected provider account.

## Invalid JSON response

The system prompt asks providers to return JSON only. The formatter also removes optional Markdown JSON fences before parsing provider output.

## Response truncated

A request failing with `Response truncated before completion` reached either `max_output_tokens` or `provider_options.context_window_size`. Since each turn re-sends the whole transcript, long conversations eventually consume the available context.

Increase `max_output_tokens` if the output cap was reached. Otherwise, raise `context_window_size` or start a new session. The error reports both limits and the actual token counts.

## Reading the logs

Each run writes `logs/log_<session_id>.log`, where `session_id` is `<YYYYMMDD>_<HHMMSS>_<8-char-uuid>`. The same id names that session's `chats/chat_<session_id>.jsonl`, so the transcript and the log can be read side by side.

Each line is UTC ISO 8601 with milliseconds, then the session id, level, module, and message:

```
2026-07-24T09:19:43.465Z 20260724_101943_ff849b40 INFO main Session started: session_id=20260724_101943_ff849b40
2026-07-24T09:19:43.466Z 20260724_101943_ff849b40 INFO config_loader Config loaded: provider=ollama model=ministral-3:8b prompt_path=prompts/kio1_system_prompt_ver1.txt
2026-07-24T09:19:43.712Z 20260724_101943_ff849b40 INFO ollama_client Model preloaded: model=ministral-3:8b duration_ms=199
2026-07-24T09:19:56.220Z 20260724_101943_ff849b40 INFO main Turn started: turn=1
2026-07-24T09:21:15.523Z 20260724_101943_ff849b40 INFO ollama_client Response received: model=ministral-3:8b duration_ms=79303 input_tokens=2280 output_tokens=550
2026-07-24T09:21:20.108Z 20260724_101943_ff849b40 INFO main Session ended: turns=1
```

Timestamps are UTC, matching the `created_at` values inside provider responses. The console shows only `ERROR`; everything else lives in the file.

| Level | Contents |
|-------|----------|
| `DEBUG` | Full request payloads and model responses, including message text |
| `INFO` | Session and turn markers, config, provider loaded, model preloaded/verified, per-request duration and token counts |
| `WARNING` | Recoverable issues, such as the formatter falling back to `ast.literal_eval` |
| `ERROR` | Startup failures and failed requests, with tracebacks |

Useful greps:

```bash
LOG=logs/$(ls -t logs/ | head -1)

grep "Response received:" $LOG   # duration and tokens per turn
grep -c "Turn started:" $LOG     # turns attempted this session
tail -1 $LOG                     # "Session ended: turns=N" if it exited cleanly
grep ERROR logs/*.log            # failures across all sessions
```

A log containing `Startup failed` with no `Session ended` line never reached the prompt. A log with neither was killed mid-session.

`input_tokens` grows every turn because the whole transcript is re-sent, while `output_tokens` stays roughly flat — the two diverging shows the cost of replaying conversation history.

Compare `Model preloaded:` against `Response received:` durations to separate startup cost from request cost. With `keep_alive: -1` the model load is paid once at startup rather than per request.

## Observability

> KIO1 now sends telemetry to the shared, remote AI4SWENG observability platform instead of a local Docker Compose stack (see [observability.md](observability.md)). The subsections below that reference `docker compose -f observability/compose.telemetry.yaml` describe the previous local setup and are pending a follow-up revision.

### Telemetry export timeouts

Messages such as:

```text
Failed to export span batch
Failed to export metrics batch
```

mean the application cannot reach the configured OpenTelemetry Collector, or the Collector rejected the request.

If the Collector requires bearer-token authentication (an `OTLP_BEARER_TOKEN` set on the Collector side, e.g. via its `docker-compose` environment), KIO1 must send the same token back, or every export attempt fails with this same timeout/retry message — the OTLP/HTTP exporter does not surface `401`/`403` responses distinctly from network failures. Set `OTLP_BEARER_TOKEN` in KIO1's environment (not `config.json`) to match the Collector's configured token before starting KIO1:

```bash
export OTLP_BEARER_TOKEN=local-dev-otlp-token
```

Confirm that the observability stack is running:

```bash
docker compose -f observability/compose.telemetry.yaml ps -a
```

Check Collector readiness:

```bash
curl -f http://127.0.0.1:13133/
```

The default application endpoint is:

```text
http://localhost:4318
```

Start the observability stack before starting KIO1 when telemetry is enabled:

```bash
docker compose -f observability/compose.telemetry.yaml up -d
```

Telemetry-export failures do not prevent provider requests from completing. However, telemetry that cannot reach the Collector may eventually be discarded after the application exporter exhausts its retries or shuts down.

### Collector missing from `docker compose ps`

The normal `docker compose ps` output only shows running containers. Include stopped containers with:

```bash
docker compose -f observability/compose.telemetry.yaml ps -a
```

Inspect the Collector logs:

```bash
docker compose -f observability/compose.telemetry.yaml logs otel-collector
```

The storage initializer should show:

```text
Exited (0)
```

This is expected. The OpenTelemetry Collector itself should show `Up`.

### Collector storage permission denied

An error similar to:

```text
mkdir /var/lib/otelcol/storage: permission denied
```

means the Collector persistent volume does not have the required ownership.

The `collector-storage-init` service normally fixes the ownership automatically. Run it again explicitly:

```bash
docker compose -f observability/compose.telemetry.yaml run --rm --no-deps \
  collector-storage-init
```

Then start the stack and inspect all container states:

```bash
docker compose -f observability/compose.telemetry.yaml up -d
docker compose -f observability/compose.telemetry.yaml ps -a
```

Do not solve this by deleting the named volume because doing so would remove queued telemetry.

### Empty Prometheus query result

A plain query such as:

```promql
kio1_turns_total
```

can return no data when the application has stopped or telemetry has been disabled. Prometheus instant queries only return recently active series.

Use a historical query:

```promql
last_over_time(kio1_turns_total[24h])
```

Confirm that KIO1 metric names exist:

```bash
curl -sS -G http://127.0.0.1:9090/api/v1/label/__name__/values \
  --data-urlencode 'match[]={__name__=~"kio1_.*|gen_ai_.*"}' \
  | python3 -m json.tool
```

If this returns metric names, the data is stored and the original query was outside the active-series time window.

### No traces returned by Tempo

Confirm that telemetry was enabled before running KIO1:

```json
"enabled": true
```

Check Collector and Tempo readiness:

```bash
curl -f http://127.0.0.1:13133/
curl -f http://127.0.0.1:3200/ready
```

Run at least one KIO1 request and type `exit` so pending telemetry is flushed.

Search again:

```bash
curl -sS -G http://127.0.0.1:3200/api/search \
  --data-urlencode 'q={ resource.service.name = "kio1-orchestrator" }' \
  | python3 -m json.tool
```

Ensure the searched service name matches `telemetry.service_name` in `config.json`.

### Observability service fails during startup

Inspect the affected service:

```bash
docker compose -f observability/compose.telemetry.yaml ps -a
```

Then read its logs:

```bash
docker compose -f observability/compose.telemetry.yaml logs SERVICE_NAME
```

Replace `SERVICE_NAME` with one of:

```text
otel-collector
tempo
prometheus
```

Validate all configuration files using the commands in the [Observability Guide](observability.md#validating-the-configuration).

### Stored telemetry was removed

The following command deletes the named observability volumes:

```bash
docker compose -f observability/compose.telemetry.yaml down -v
```

Data deleted this way cannot be recovered unless the volumes were backed up separately.

The safe shutdown command is:

```bash
docker compose -f observability/compose.telemetry.yaml stop
```
